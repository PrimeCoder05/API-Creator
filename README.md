This folder holds some custom API's that I have made in order to test and create projects.

**This folder will be regularly updated and will be available for use after each intallment.**

> Note: Releases will be added in order for you to dowload this entire folder for your own personal use.

Here are some API's currently available for use:
- SSBC: an API based off of Nintendo's characters from Super Smash Brothers.
